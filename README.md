A calculator app cretated with HTML,CSS and JavaScript.This project taught me how to manipulate strings usings built in javascript methods,convertings string to arrays and vice verca while also manipulating DOM.Furthermore,i created a simple manimalist GUI using linear colors rather than just plain colos as i used to in previous projects.
